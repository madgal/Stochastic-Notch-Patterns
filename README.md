# Stochastic-Notch-Patterns
Here you'll find the code for generating and analyzing Notch-Delta mediated pattern formation. Our results can be found in "Stochastic fluctuations promote ordered pattern formation of cells in the Notch-Delta signaling pathway"

Please cite the preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00763 if you use this code.
